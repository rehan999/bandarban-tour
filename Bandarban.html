            <p >Bogakain Lake, also called Baga Lake or Boga Lake, is a lake located in Ruma Upazila in the hill district Bandarban, Bangladesh.[1] It is a natural sweet and deep water lake. Its height from sea level is nearly 1,246 feet (380 m). Geologists believe that it was created by collection of rain water in summer. The lake is irregular in shape.[1] A team of geologists surveyed this lake in 1973. They found the lake's water to be too acidic for any form of life. By the year 1995, the lake's water became abundant with plants and fish. The local residents culture and gather Tilapia fish in this lake.People of Bawm tribe migrated from Saikot para to Boga Lake and set up this village.A local legend tells that the lake was created after the inhabitants of a Khumi village killed and later devoured a deity who later reappeared to them in the form of a dragon. Instantly an earthquake occurred, the hillside caved in, and the village disappeared and formed a deep lake.</p>

                Nafa-khum (Bengali: নাফাখুম) is a waterfall in Bangladesh on the Remaikree River, a tributary of the Sangu River. It is among the largest waterfalls in the country by volume of water falling. The wild hilly Remaikree river suddenly falls down here about 25–30 feet or 7.62-9.144 meters.The word Ngafa (ঙাফা) in native Marma language means Baghair fish/ Dwarf goonch and "Khong" means "Ground". A special type of flying fish, whose local name is nating, is found at the bottom in a small cave as they swim against the stream but cannot jump over the height of the fall.
